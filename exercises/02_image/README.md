# Exercise 2: Embedding Images

In this exercise, you will embed the two images in the `images` subdirectory (`cat.jpg` and `dog.jpg`) into an HTML page. Use the skeleton in `exercises/02_image/exercise.html`.

## Steps

1. Create a paragraph below the headline "Cats" and embed `cat.jpg` at full size in this paragraph (width: 400px, height: 283px).<br />
(See [information about the `img` tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)).

2.  Create another paragraph below the headline "Dogs" and embed `dog.jpg` at half size in this paragraph (width: 400px, height: 283px)

**NB**: In practice, *don't* use the `width` and `height` properties to resize images. Resize your images to the exact size for your experiment with the Preview app or some other image editing software (if you need multiple sizes, create multiple versions) and always include images of the right size. Resizing your images in the browser might lead to blurry images and if you use a larger version than needed, you are unnecessarily increasing the time to to load a page. (larger images have larger file sizes and need longer to be downloaded!)
