# Exercise 8: Playing Audio

In this exercise, you will include an audio player.
Use the skeleton in `exercises/08_basic_audio/exercise.html`.

Playing audio on a web page always used to be a bit of a hassle because HTML
did not provide this functionality and you had to include things like Flash
audio players. Fortunately, HTML5 now defines an `audio` element which can be
used to play audio files. However, as this is a fairly new addition, it has not
been completely standardized and therefore some browsers can only play some types
of audio. You should therefore always prepare your stimuli as mp3 and as ogg
encoded audio files.


## Steps

1. Add an [audio player](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp)
to play the `boogalooo` audio file in the audio directory.
