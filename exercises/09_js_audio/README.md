# Exercise 9: Loading Audio via Javascript

In this exercise, you will include an audio player via Javascript so that you can
go through multiple audio files. Use the skeleton in `exercises/09_js_audio/exercise.html`.

In this exercise, I defined a list of stimuli in the file `stims.js`. You don't need
to edit this file but take a look at it, so that you know the structure of each
stimulus.

# Steps

1. Complete the function `loadNextAudio`. You just have to update the title and
you have to include the HTML for the audio player with the correct audio. (Hint:
  use the `text` and `html` functions).

  Also, try to understand what is happening with the variable `i` and why you can
  loop through the list multiple times.
